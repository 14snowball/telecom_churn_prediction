# telecom_churn_prediction

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
In the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% of customers (called high-value customers). Thus, if we can reduce the churn of high-value customers, we will be able to reduce significant revenue leakage.
